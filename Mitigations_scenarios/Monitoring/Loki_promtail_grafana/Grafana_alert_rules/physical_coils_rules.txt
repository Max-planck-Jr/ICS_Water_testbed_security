    Rule : count_over_time({container_name="MTU"} |= "coil data X0: [False]" |= "P-101: Active"[1m]) > 1
    Alert : X0 Turned Off While P-101 Running — Potential Denial Condition attack


5. Name : Sudden Coil Deactivation During Operation for P 102
    Rule : count_over_time({container_name="MTU"} |= "coil data X1: [False]" |= "P-102: Active"[1m]) > 1
    Alert : X1 Turned Off While P-101 Running — Potential Denial Condition attack


6. Name : All Coils Flipping to TRUE Rapidly (Flooding or Attack)
    Rule : count_over_time({container_name="MTU"} |= "coil data X" |= "[True]"[1m]) > 12
    Alert : Mass Coil Activation Detected — Check for Command Injection


7. Name : Frequent Flip of Coil X0 to False (Suspicious Idle)
    Rule : count_over_time({container_name="MTU"} |= "coil data X0: [False]"[1m]) > 5
    Alert : X0 Coil Frequently Flipping to False — Possible Fault or Manual Override on Pump P-101


8. Name : Frequent Flip of Coil X1 to False (Suspicious Idle)
    Rule : count_over_time({container_name="MTU"} |= "coil data X1: [False]"[1m]) > 5
    Alert : X1 Coil Frequently Flipping to False — Possible Fault or Manual Override on Pump P-102

    Alert : MV-201 Repeated Inactivity


12. Name : Activity at Odd Hours (Off-Schedule Command Execution)
    Rule : count_over_time({container_name="MTU"} |= "coil data X*" |= "[True]"[1h] offset 1d) > 15
    Alert : Unusual Coil Triggering Outside of Operating Hours (Assumes your system should be mostly idle overnight. )


13. Name : Frequent Alternating Coil States (e.g., X1 going TRUE/FALSE rapidly)
    Rule : rate({container_name="MTU"} |= "coil data X1"[5m]) > 0.5
    Alert : pump 102 Rapid State Fluctuation — Potential Injection or Faulty Logic


14. Name : Frequent Alternating Coil States (e.g., X0 going TRUE/FALSE rapidly)
    Rule : rate({container_name="MTU"} |= "coil data X0"[5m]) > 0.5
